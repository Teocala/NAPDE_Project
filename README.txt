This is the private repository for the "Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential Equations" project by Matteo Calaf√† and Federica Botta about the bidomain model for the electrophysiology of the heart. 
The goal is to improve two already implemented Matlab codes that consist in a Discontinuos Galerkin resolution of, respectively, the monodomain problem and the bidomain problem.
