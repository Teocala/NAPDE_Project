This is the private repository for the "Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential Equations" project by Matteo Calaf√† and Federica Botta about the bidomain model for the electrophysiology of the heart. 
The goal is to improve two already implemented Matlab codes that consist in a Discontinuos Galerkin resolution of, respectively, the monodomain problem and the bidomain problem.

The main branch is Master_Matteo that can push in every moment into the repository.
Master_Federica can be updated pulling in every moment, however it can push only through a pull request
