DISCONTINUOS GALERKIN APPROXIMATION FOR CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
-----------------------------------------------------------------


This is the private repository for the "*Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential Equations*" project by *Matteo Calaf√†* and *Federica Botta*.
At the moment, the goal is to improve two already implemented Matlab codes that consist in a Discontinuous Galerkin resolution of, respectively, the monodomain problem and the bidomain problem.


------------------------------
###GIT REMINDERS:###

1. Only *master_matteo* and *master_fede* branches can have access and modify the repository

2. The two branches should **not** modify the repository simultaneously, otherwise git leads to the occurring of conflicts. For this reason each member should care of:
    - checking that the proper branch is up to date with the other before pushing on the repository 
    - communicating to the mate the intention to modify the code by his/her own
    
3. Everytime the repository is committed a "*pull request*" must be made in order to get the other branch updated. Successively, a `git pull` is enough to update the local branch. Remember that:
    - both members can make the pull request, either the one who wants to be updated or the one who wants the other to be updated
    - a description of the pull request is not necessary (even if it is asked 3 times) and it would be better to leave it blank
    - a title is instead necessary, you find it at the last step, just before "confirm request"
    - the default title will be "<u>pull request by AAA</u>" if AAA wants to be updated or "<u>pull request for BBB</u>" if AAA wants BBB to be updated
    
4. Even if quite obvious, commits must be made at EVERY little change of the code and must have a clear title (though not too into details, the modified lines can indeed be directly viewed)
